<p class="col-xs-12">Our reviews are anonymous. If you are a musician then you know how hard it can be to get an honest review of one of your songs. Family and friends 
tend to like every song you write and offer very little feedback about how to improve your music. Social media sites and many existing musician sites 
put much more emphasis on popularity and how many people you can get to a show, or like your profile, than letting you know if your songs are really 
any good or what can be done to make them better. The ability to draw a crowd is a very important benchmark for musicians, but it is more a 
measure of your marketing skills than your song writing skills. Anonymous reviews allow everything but the music to be stripped away. <a title = "About" href="about.php">Read More</a></p>
